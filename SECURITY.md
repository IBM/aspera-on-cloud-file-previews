# Reporting and Fixing Security Issues

Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions or pull request - this makes the problem immediately visible to everyone, including malicious actors.

Instead, security issues in this open source project can be safely reported to IBM via coordinated disclosure: [IBM Support](https://www.ibm.com/mysupport/s/?language=en_US), [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/users/sign_in), [email](psirt@us.ibm.com) or [anonymously](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/feedback/security-psirt).

Please include as much of the information listed below as you can to help us better understand and resolve the issue:

- The type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

The IBM Aspera admin team will triage your report and determine the appropriate remediation and disclosure next steps.
